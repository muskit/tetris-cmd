### *NOTE: THIS IS A PROTOTYPE CREATED WHILE LEARNING C++ IN 2018. I HAVE NO PLANS ON CONTINUING THIS PROJECT, AND THE CODE IN THIS PROJECT IS NOT INDICATIVE OF MY CURRENT CODING STYLE.*

# tetris-cmd
Tetris for the Windows Command Prompt.

Uses Super Rotation, Initial Rotation, Initial Hold, (Initial) Auto Shift, and 7-bag.

**NOTE:** it is highly recommended that you set your console font to "Raster Fonts" 12x16 *when you run the executable!*
